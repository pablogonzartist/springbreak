    <p>Unfortunately, I did not have much time to work on this project due to being out of town! However, I hope you enjoy the following images that were taken during my beautiful trip to Serenbe, Georgia.
    It's where they filmed the Divergent Movies as well as the Walking Dead (close to Senoia, Georgia)
